# Problem Statements:
Students around the world often struggle to find a mentor that can guide towards  their school application, or to find scholarships that match their criteria. Though Linkedin is available to connect students and professionals, it is hard to find scholarships, or even match with a professional that can give you mentorship at all times. This is often hard for international students.

# Personas:
Persona 1 (Mentee): Ali goes to high school in Senegal and is interested in applying for college in America, but Ali does not know what school to go to because there are so many in America.

Persona 2 (Mentee): Joe is a fourth-year college student at the University of Peru, and wants to apply for internships in America. Joe has applied to many companies, but never received an interview and wants to get his resume reviewed by someone who works in corporate America.

Persona 3(Mentee): Abby is a freshman at the University of London and has many interests that range from biology, finance, computing, and political science. Abby is not sure what major to declare and would like to receive advice from someone who has been in her shoes or who has had experience in one of her industries of interest. However, Abby prefers to have a mentor who lives in Paris as she wishes to work there.

Persona 4 (Mentor): Michael is currently working at Meta in their Dublin office and is interested in getting more students from Dublin to apply to meta roles and while helping them prepare for interviews. However, he does not know how or who to reach out to, thus he could just sign into our web app and will get matched with students who want to work at Meta

Persona 5 (Mentor): Michelle is a graduate student at Cornell pursuing a master’s in Biomedical sciences and needs some volunteering hours to apply for medical school. However, she wants to use her volunteering hours in mentoring students who want to pursue medical sciences. She could find those students on our app and get her volunteering hours approved based on how long and how many students she mentors.
